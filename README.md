Software Engineer | Java & Spring Boot Specialist | Performance & Cloud Optimization

Performance-focused Software Engineer with solid experience in backend and frontend development using Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and TypeScript. I’ve contributed to robust enterprise applications by applying clean architecture patterns (MVC), managing dependencies with Maven, and using relational databases like PostgreSQL and Oracle.

Skilled in developing and integrating RESTful APIs, I also bring hands-on experience with modern UI frameworks such as PrimeFaces, RichFaces, React, and Ionic. My DevOps toolkit includes Docker, Kubernetes, Git, and CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

In cloud environments, I’ve used observability tools like Kibana and AppDynamics to monitor systems and reduce AWS infrastructure costs. I specialize in JVM tuning and Garbage Collector optimization, and I conduct load and stress testing using JMeter.

I’m experienced in building scalable microservices and implementing asynchronous communication using Apache Camel, ActiveMQ, and Kafka.

With over 2 years of leadership experience, I have successfully managed ERP projects by applying PMI methodologies, leading cross-functional teams, and ensuring high client satisfaction. Fluent in Portuguese, English, and Spanish, I thrive in multicultural, fast-paced environments and enjoy solving complex technical challenges.
